# Retro-Thirds-Pebble-Watchface

A simple watch face with some cool fonts I found that shows time, date, weather, battery percentage, and an indicator for no BT connection.
It has colors split into thirds, by default in an RGB pattern. The colors of each third as well as each section of text can be changed.
